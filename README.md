## Learning Log
Learning Log is an online learning tool that lets you journal your progress through learning a topic.

Learning Log is the final project of the book [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e/) by Eric Matthes. The project focuses on making a functional and styled web application using Django and Bootstrap.

## Visiting Learning Log
A functioning version of the project is currently being hosted on Heroku. To access it just click [here](https://pycc-learning-log.herokuapp.com/). Keep in mind that Heroku puts to sleep any inactive project, so you will have to refresh the page/be patient as it wakes up :smile:
